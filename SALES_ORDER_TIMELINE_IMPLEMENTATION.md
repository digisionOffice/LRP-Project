# Sales Order Timeline Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of a dedicated sales order timeline page that replaces the previous modal popup approach. The timeline displays accurate and relevant information based on the actual data structure in the system.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Removed Modal Approach

-   **Before**: Timeline was displayed in a modal popup triggered from the main timeline page
-   **After**: Dedicated page route for viewing timeline details with proper navigation

### 2. Fixed Routing and Parameter Binding

-   **Issue**: Laravel dependency injection error with route parameters in Filament pages
-   **Solution**: Changed from route parameter `{record}` to query parameter `?record=`
-   **URL Format**: `/admin/sales-order-timeline-detail?record={id}` instead of `/admin/sales-order-timeline-detail/{record}`
-   **Benefits**: Avoids Filament's dependency injection issues while maintaining clean URLs

### 3. Updated SalesOrderTimeline Page

-   **File**: `app/Filament/Pages/SalesOrderTimeline.php`
-   **Changes**:
    -   Removed modal-related code and infolist functionality
    -   Updated table action to redirect to dedicated detail page using query parameters
    -   Simplified page to focus on listing sales orders with filter capabilities

### 4. Created SalesOrderTimelineDetail Page

-   **File**: `app/Filament/Pages/SalesOrderTimelineDetail.php`
-   **Features**:
    -   Dedicated route: `/admin/sales-order-timeline-detail?record={id}`
    -   Uses query parameter approach to avoid Filament dependency injection issues
    -   Comprehensive timeline event generation
    -   Proper breadcrumb navigation
    -   Optimized data loading with eager loading

### 5. Updated View Templates

-   **Main Timeline Page**: `resources/views/filament/pages/sales-order-timeline.blade.php`

    -   Simplified to show only the sales orders table
    -   Removed timeline section that was conditionally displayed

-   **Detail Timeline Page**: `resources/views/filament/pages/sales-order-timeline-detail.blade.php`
    -   Full-width responsive design
    -   Comprehensive sales order summary
    -   Chronological timeline with proper icons and colors
    -   Handles empty states gracefully

### 6. Data Accuracy Improvements

-   **Verified Field Names**: Updated to use correct database field names (e.g., `waktu_tiba` instead of `waktu_sampai`)
-   **Removed Non-existent Features**: Eliminated invoice-related information since invoice functionality is not implemented
-   **Added Data Validation**: Only displays timeline events that have actual data

## Timeline Events Displayed

The timeline accurately shows the following events based on available data:

### 1. Sales Order Created

-   **Data Source**: `TransaksiPenjualan` model
-   **Information**: SO number, customer, fuel types, volume, TBBM, created by

### 2. Delivery Order Created

-   **Data Source**: `DeliveryOrder` model
-   **Information**: DO number, delivery date, vehicle, driver, seal number, status

### 3. Loading Events (when available)

-   **Loading Started**: When `waktu_muat` is set
-   **Loading Completed**: When `waktu_selesai_muat` is set
-   **Data Source**: `DeliveryOrder.waktu_muat` and `DeliveryOrder.waktu_selesai_muat`

### 4. Driver Allowance (when available)

-   **Data Source**: `UangJalan` model
-   **Information**: Amount, send status, receive status, driver

### 5. Delivery Progress (when available)

-   **Delivery Departed**: When `waktu_berangkat` is set
-   **Delivery Arrived**: When `waktu_tiba` is set
-   **Delivery Completed**: When `waktu_selesai` is set
-   **Data Source**: `PengirimanDriver` model

## Authorization Configuration

### Filament Shield Exclusion

-   **File**: `config/filament-shield.php`
-   **Added**: `SalesOrderTimelineDetail` to the excluded pages list
-   **Result**: Both timeline pages are accessible to all authenticated admin users regardless of roles

## Comprehensive Test Suite

### 1. Feature Tests

-   **File**: `tests/Feature/SalesOrderTimelineTest.php`
-   **Coverage**:
    -   Page access and authorization
    -   Timeline data rendering
    -   Data filtering functionality
    -   Navigation between pages
    -   Timeline detail page functionality

### 2. Unit Tests

-   **File**: `tests/Unit/SalesOrderTimelineComponentTest.php`
-   **Coverage**:
    -   Timeline event generation logic
    -   Data sorting and chronological order
    -   Component integration
    -   Performance with large datasets

### 3. Edge Case Tests

-   **File**: `tests/Feature/SalesOrderTimelineEdgeCasesTest.php`
-   **Coverage**:
    -   Empty data sets
    -   Missing relationships
    -   Invalid date ranges
    -   Large datasets
    -   Concurrent events
    -   Memory usage

### 4. View Tests

-   **File**: `tests/Feature/SalesOrderTimelineViewTest.php`

    -   View rendering
    -   Responsive design
    -   Accessibility features

## Model Factories Created

To support comprehensive testing, the following factories were created:

-   `TransaksiPenjualanFactory`
-   `PelangganFactory`
-   `ItemFactory`
-   `TbbmFactory`
-   `KendaraanFactory`
-   `DeliveryOrderFactory`
-   `PenjualanDetailFactory`
-   `UangJalanFactory`
-   `PengirimanDriverFactory`

## Test Data Seeder

-   **File**: `database/seeders/SalesOrderTimelineTestSeeder.php`
-   **Purpose**: Creates comprehensive test data for timeline functionality
-   **Includes**: Various scenarios including edge cases and multiple delivery orders

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Optimized Queries

-   Eager loading of relationships to prevent N+1 queries
-   Indexed database fields for efficient filtering
-   Proper pagination on the main timeline page

### 2. Memory Management

-   Events are generated on-demand
-   Efficient data structures used for timeline events
-   Tested with large datasets to ensure reasonable memory usage

### 3. Response Time

-   Timeline detail page loads within acceptable time limits
-   Tested with up to 20 delivery orders per sales order
-   Performance tests ensure sub-2-second response times

## Browser Compatibility

The timeline interface is built with:

-   Responsive Tailwind CSS classes
-   Dark mode support
-   Accessibility features (ARIA attributes, semantic HTML)
-   Cross-browser compatible SVG icons

## Security Features

-   Proper authentication required for all timeline pages
-   XSS protection through Laravel's built-in escaping
-   CSRF protection on all forms
-   Input validation and sanitization

## Future Enhancements

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for future enhancements:

-   Real-time updates via WebSockets
-   Export functionality for timeline data
-   Advanced filtering options
-   Timeline event notifications
-   Integration with external tracking systems

## Running Tests

To run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Run all timeline tests
php artisan test --filter=SalesOrderTimeline

# Run specific test categories
php artisan test tests/Feature/SalesOrderTimelineTest.php
php artisan test tests/Unit/SalesOrderTimelineComponentTest.php
php artisan test tests/Feature/SalesOrderTimelineEdgeCasesTest.php
php artisan test tests/Feature/SalesOrderTimelineViewTest.php

# Run with coverage
php artisan test --coverage --filter=SalesOrderTimeline
```
